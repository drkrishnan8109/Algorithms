/**
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting/
 *
 * Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices
 * such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
 * Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.
 *
 * Topological sort is for Directed Acyclic Grpahs. Doesnt work if not DAG.
 * Hence detect cycle if required.
 *
 * Uses:
 * Cycle detection in directed acyclic graph *
 * Course schedule order or Course schedule cycle
 * Data Serialization
 * Resolving dependancies in linkers
 *
 * **Similar to DFS, using recursion stack
 * Diff from DFs because: In DFs, we first print a vertex and then recurse. But
 * in top sorting here : 5-> 0 <-4 Here both 5 and 4 have to be printed before 0
 * So use a stack and reverse the order.
 *  In DFS, we start from a vertex, we first print it and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices.
 *  In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately,
 *  we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack.
 *  Finally, print contents of the stack. Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when all of
 *  its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in the stack.
 *
 * Since it is just like DFs, TC is O(V+E)
