/*
Goal: The Builder Pattern is used to construct complex objects step by step.
It is particularly useful when an object requires numerous optional parameters or
when the objectâ€™s construction involves multiple parts.
Use Case: Ideal for creating objects that may have a large number of configurations
and where the construction process needs to be separated from the representation of the object.
